# Dictators
the best game since the dawn of time


Dependencies for django:

python3.8, pip3, pipenv (I think it is pretty simple to install, in case of trouble you know how to contact me)

Execute following commands

```shell
pipenv sync
pipenv run python manage.py migrate
pipenv run python manage.py runserver
```

By default, it will run local web server on localhost:8000. Choose room id (integer) and your character (X, O), open second browser window, choose same room id and different character.
Enjoy this game.
